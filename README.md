Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

This repository hosts the R code and documentation for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data".

The dataset is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

All of the data is in one main directory (the directory is set at the beginning of the code).

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses requested for the assignment.

The output is called `tidy_data.txt`.
